	<h2>Welcome to Beginner's Bonfire</h2>
	
	
	<p>
		Welcome to Beginner's Bonfire, a <cite>Dark Souls 3</cite> tutorial website. If you're struggling with the brutal difficulty of the game and need some help getting good, this is the place to be. 
		Soon you too can enjoy the euphoric combat and gorgeous world of <cite>Dark Souls 3</cite>.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		While this site specifically covers mechanics in <cite>Dark Souls 3</cite>, it's important to understand that other games made by <cite>From Software</cite> 
		(such as <cite>Demon's Souls</cite>, <cite>Dark Souls</cite>, <cite>Dark Souls 2</cite> and <cite>Bloodborne</cite>) follow a similar formula.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		It is my goal to create a comprehensive guide for new players that is spoiler free. <cite>Dark Souls 3</cite> has incredible moments of discovery, 
		and such it's best experienced when playing without any knowledge of the lore to begin with. 
		That being said, it's difficult for beginners to find these moments because of the steep learning curve and cluttered interface of the game. 
		This website should help struggling players find their footing and be able to explore the world more confidently without spoiling any of the discoveries to come.
