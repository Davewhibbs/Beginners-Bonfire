<h2>Combat</h2>
<h3>Combat Overview</h3>
<p>
	Combat in <cite>Dark Souls 3</cite> is one of the most immersive combat systems in any game. The controls and hitboxes are incredibly tight and every hit feels like it truly has power behind it.
	That being said, being unprepared for combat in <cite>Dark Souls 3</cite> can lead to a very frustrating run. If you allow enemies to hit you even just a couple times, you'll die. Most bosses
	can two or even one shot you. However, the main concept to remember is that every single attack, whether it is yours or an enemy's, has a windup time before it actually strikes and a cooldown time
	after a strike where the character is vulnerable. Always try to time your attacks to hit when your opponent is in those vulnerable states and you are in a safe position. It takes practice to fully
	understand how to fight in <cite>Dark Souls 3</cite> but once you've figured it out, it can be some of the most satisfying combat you'll ever experience in a game.
</p>

<h3>Weapon Movesets</h3>
<p>
	You can beat <cite>Dark Souls 3</cite> using any weapon. Every weapon has the potential to carry you through the game, however every weapon in <cite>Dark Souls 3</cite> has a unique moveset. 
	The timing and direction of the swing of a weapon is different between them all, offering a huge variety of options for how you want to approach combat. If you like to attack quickly with less
	damage per swing, pick up a katana or a longsword. If you like to pack a real punch when you strike, pick up a great sword or a great axe. There are so many options, the weapon variety is the 
	real replayability that the game offers. Try out every weapon you find until you come across one that really matches your playstyle. In other words, no weapon is objectively better than any other,
	just use what you like to use.
</p>

<h3>Stamina Management</h3>
<p>
	The most important thing to keep in mind when you're fighting (besides your health) is your stamina bar. That is the green bar on the top left of the screen. Every action besides walking consumes stamina,
	and if you run out of stamina you will become incredibly vulnerable. If you get low on stamina, make sure to leave enough for you to back off to a safe distance to recharge. It recharges fairly quickly so you can reenter 
	fights without waiting too long, but be careful if you are using a shield; holding a shield up to protect you will cause you regenerate stamina much more slowly.
	Only hold up your shield if you think you are about to be hit by something.
</p>

<h3>Combat Basics</h3>

<h4>Target Lock-On</h4>
<p>
	Perhaps one of the most fundamental and useful tools for beginners to use in combat is the capability to lock-on to targets. Push down on the right stick (R3) to target a foe if you are close enough.
	If there are multiple enemies nearby you can change your taget by moving the right stick. When locked-on, you'll continually face the enemy even if you move around. If there aren't any foes close enough to 
	lock-on to, pressing the right stick (R3) will reset the camera.
</p>	
		<h5>Tips:</h5>
		<ul>
			<li>
				If you feel comfortable, try fighting without locking on. 
				This will help you learn your weapon's hit-boxes a lot better and allows a much more free range of movement when fighting enemies, but can be difficult to aim
				if you don't know what you're doing.
			</li>	
		</ul>


<h4>Light Attack</h4>
<p>
	Perform a light attack by pressing the right bumper (R1) on your gamepad.
	The light attack is your bread and butter attack move. It's usually the fastest attack you can use on any weapon, while also offering the least damage per swing. 
</p>	
	<h5>Tips:</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Its quick windup, cooldown, and low stamina cost
			makes the light attack ideal for chaining together attacks and for escaping quickly to safety after striking.
		</li>
	</ul>


<h4>Heavy Attack</h4>
<p>
	Perform a heavy attack by pressing the right trigger (R2) on your gamepad.
	The heavy attack is considerably slower and costs more stamina but deals more damage than the light attack. You can also charge up the heavy attack by holding down R2 (the right trigger). Charging the heavy attack
	will cause it to deal extra damage. 
</p>	
	<h5>Tips:</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>
			You don't have to charge up a heavy attack all the way, making it great for timing powerful blows.
		</li>
	</ul> 


<h4>Dual Wield</h4>
<p>
	Tap the Y button to dual wield your right hand weapon. Dual wielding will cause you to no longer be able to use your left hand weapon, but your light and heavy attack will have different animations and
	will deal more damage than single-handed.
</p>	
	<h5>Tips:</h5>
	<ul>
	
		<li>
			Tap Y again to stop dual wielding.
		</li>
		<li>
			Hold down the Y button to dual wield your left hand weapon.
		</li>	
		
		
	</ul>


<h4>Weapon Art</h4>
<p>
	When dual wielding your weapon, press the left trigger to perform your weapon's Weapon Art. The Weapon Art is a special attack that is different on each weapon and costs both stamina and focus points 
	to use.
</p>	
	<h5>Tips:</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>
			You can check what your weapon's Weapon Art is by looking in the description of the item.
		</li>
	</ul>


<h4>Blocking</h4>
<p>
	If you have a shield equipped in your left hand, you can press and hold the right bumper (R1) to protect your front with the shield. If an enemy strikes you in this state, you will recieve
	significantly less damage (or none at all depending on your shield), lose a certain amount of stamina
	based on how powerful the enemy's blow was, and the enemy will recoil a little, opening a window of opportunity for you to strike back. Having your shield up will cause
	stamina to regenerate much slower than normal.
</p>	
	<h5>Tips:</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>
			If you have a shield with 100% Physical defense, it will block all damage done by almost all enemy attacks in the game apart from elemental and magical damage.
		</li>
		
		<li>
			Shields with higher Stability will cause you to lose less stamina when blocking attacks.
		</li>
	</ul>




<h4>Dodge Roll</h4>
<p>
	Tap the B button on your gamepad to perform a dodge roll at the cost of stamina. Your character will dodge in whichever direction you are pressing on the left stick, or will make a short hop backwards if you are not pressing
	any direction with the left stick. A dodge roll will allow your character to quickly cover a short distance, and also offers invincibility frames at the beginning of the dodge animation.
	This means that if you time a dodge roll correctly, you can negate any damage that would have hit you even if the animation of the enemy swinging still clips your characters model. 
</p>	
	<h5>Tips:</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Try to time a dodge roll for right when an enemey is about to hit you and you won't recieve any damage.
		</li>
		
		<li>
			The effectiveness of your roll is based on your Equipment Load stat. 
			If your Weight Ratio is 70% or above, you will roll slower and have fewer invincibility frames.
			If your Weight Ratio is above 100%, you will walk very slowly and will not be able to roll at all.
		</li>
		<li>
			Always try to keep your Weight Ratio below 70% in order to roll faster and have the most invincibility frames possible, even if it means equipping lighter armor.
		</li>
		
		<li>
			You can increase your maximum Equip Load by increasing your Vitality stat at the Firekeeper.
		</li>
	</ul>	


<h4>Sprinting</h4>
<p>
	Hold down the B button on your gamepad to make your character continually run faster at the cost of stamina. The stamina cost is fairly low, but keep in mind that you should not enter a fight right after you've sprinted because
	you may be down a lot of stamina. 
</p>	
	<h5>Tips:</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Use this to cover large distances as fast as possible or to flee from enemies.
		</li>
		
		<li>
			You cannot sprint if your Weight Ratio is above 100%.
		</li>
	
	</ul>
