<h2>Advanced Combat Techniques</h2>


<div id="leftside">
<h3>Critical Strikes</h3>

<p>
	Sometimes an enemy can be especially vulnerable. You can take advantage of turned backs and moments of extreme vulnerability with Critical Strikes. 
	When performing a Critical Strike, you will become invincible for the duration of the animation and the enemy will take extreme damage.
	There are several ways to perform a Critical Strike.
</p>

<h4>Backstab</h4>
<p>
	If you manage to sneak up behind an enemy without them noticing, or are able to strafe around them mid-combat, you have the option to perform a Backstab. 
	To perform a Backstab, you have to be standing directly behind an enemy and have your shield down, then perform a light attack. If you've positioned yourself correctly,
	you and the enemy will become locked in the Backstab animation, during which you'll be invincible and you'll deal a ton of damage in one strike.
	
	<h5>Tips:</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>
		Make sure you put your shield down before you backstab, otherwise you'll just perform a light attack and miss your window of opportunity.
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>


<h4>Parry</h4>
<p>
	Perhaps one of the most difficult maneuvers to master in <cite>Dark Souls 3</cite> is the Parry. To parry, you must have a shield or something that can use Parry equipped in your left hand
	(Not all shields can parry, but some fist weapons and daggers can). To perform a parry, press the left trigger (L2). This move deals no damage and leaves you standing still and vulnerable to an attack,
	however if you time it just right so that an enemy's attack hits your shield right as you parry, an audio queue will play and the enemy will stand still, dazed and vulnerable to a riposte. From that point,
	walk until you are right in front of their chest, and perform a light attack. A front stab animation will play, you'll be invincible during the duration and your enemy will take even more damage than
	a backstab would inflict.
	
	<h5>Tips:</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Small shields are better at parrying than larger shields, as they have more frames during the parry animation that can cause a parry to happen. Fist weapons have even more parry frames. The tradeoff
			for better parrying is significantly reduced, or even completely reduced in the case of fist weapons, protection with blocks.
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Most enemies can be parried, even some bosses. Use common sense though, you can't parry a giant if it's trying to step on you.
		</li>
	
		<li>
			If a player <em>dual wields</em> an Ultra-Greatsword, a Greataxe, or a Greathammer, their attacks cannot be parried.
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h4>Kick</h4>
<p>
	To perform a kick, tap up on the left stick (L3) and tap the right bumper (R1) at the same time. Kick enemies when they have their shield up to break their guard, and an audio queue will play leaving them vulnerable.
	Proceed to front stab them as if you had parried.
	
	<h5>Tips:</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>
			You can also kick enemies to interrupt their attacks and push them back a little for you to follow up with a standard attack (No critical strike).
		</li>
		
		<li>
			You can also utilize the kick's knockback to push enemies off cliffs.
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h4>Guard Break</h4>
<p>
	Another option for when an enemy has a shield up is to simply attack their shield until they run out of stamina, at which point they will be vulnerable for a front stab.
	
	<h5>Tips:</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Be careful when attempting to guard break by attacking, as attacking a shield will quickly deplete all of your stamina.
		</li>
		
		<li>
			Never attempt to do this against someone using a Greatshield, as the stamina consumption for blocking with a Greatshield is very small and it's more likely you'll run out of stamina first.
			Instead, kick their Greatshield twice to break their guard.
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>


<h4>Plunging Attack</h4>
<p>
	If you ever find yourself in a situation where you can drop down from a ledge on top of an enemy, you can perform a light attack while you're falling to perform a Plunging Attack.
	Plunging Attacks deal incredibly high damage, so always take the chance to perform one if you can.
	
	<h5>Tips:</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>
			You can jump by pressing the left stick (L3) while running. While the regular jump is not high enough to initiate a Plunging Attack, it can make some ledges that would otherwise be to short
			to be just high enough to initiate a Plunging Attack.
		</li>
		
		<li>
			Jumping can also be used to jump over gaps that might not otherwise be crossable.
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h3>Status Effects</h3>
<p>
	There are a few status effects that you can inflict on your enemies with certain weapons and spells, and some enemies can even inflict
	them upon you. These Status Effects include:
	
	<ul>
		<li>Bleed</li>
		<li>Poison</li>
		<li>Toxic</li>
		<li>Frost</li>
		<li>Curse</li>
	</ul>
</p>	
	
<p>	
	When you are hit with something that inflicts a status effect, a bar will appear in the middle of the screen indicating the effect's build up.
	If the bar fills all the way up, you will become affected by the effect. You can inflict Status Effects on you enemies the exact same way,
	however you cannot see the bar of buildup on any character other than yourself.
</p>

<h4>Bleed</h4>
<p>
	Once the Bleed bar has been fully built up, you'll see an explosion of blood on the character and that characcter will take a massive chunk of damage.
</p>
<h5>Tips:</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Use the <strong>Bloodred Moss Clump</strong> item to get rid of any Bleed build up on your character.
		</li>
		
		<li>
			You can use the <strong>Carthus Rouge</strong> item to buff your weapon with the Bleed effect. If your weapon already has a Bleed effect, the Carthus
			Rouge will cause Bleed to build in bigger chunks per hit.
		</li>
	</ul>
	
<h4>Poison</h4>

<p>
	Once the Poison Bar has been fully built up, the character will start emitting purple vapor and will slowly lose health over time.
</p>
<h5>Tips:</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Use the <strong>Purple Moss Clump</strong> item to cure the Poison effect and get rid of any Poison build up on your character.
		</li>
		
		<li>
			You can use the <strong>Rotten Pine Resin</strong> item to buff your weapon with the Poison effect. If your weapon already has a Poison effect, the Rotten
			Pine Resin will cause Poison to build in bigger chunks per hit.
		</li>
	</ul>

<h4>Toxic</h4>
<p>
	The Toxic status is exactly like the Poison Status, however the health lost per second is significantly greater, making it much more dangerous than Poison.
	
</p>

<h5>Tips:</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Make sure to use the <strong>Blooming Purple Moss Clump</strong> item to cure the Toxic effect and to get rid of any Toxic build up on your character.
		</li>
	</ul>

<h4>Frost</h4>
<p>
	Frost works similar to Bleed. Once Frost has been fully built on a target, they will take a chunk of damage and they will also have temporarily lowered
	stamina regeneration.
</p>

<h5>Tips:</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Use the <strong>Rime Blue Moss Clump</strong> item to cure the Toxic effect and to get rid of any Frost build up on your character.
		</li>
	</ul>

<h4>Curse</h4>
<p>
	The most dangerous of all the status effects, when Curse is fully built up your character will turn into a statue and instantly die.

</p>
<h5>Tips:</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Make sure to use the <strong>Purging Stone</strong> item to get rid of any Curse build up on your character.
		</li>
		
		<li>
			Fun Fact: Other statues that look like players are actually other players that were cursed and turned to stone.
		</li>
	</ul>
