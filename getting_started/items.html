<h2>Items</h2>
<h3>Items Overview</h3>
<p>
	Items can be found throughout the game on corpses with a shining white marker above them. Items are also
	purchasable from vendors. You can view all of your items by pressing Start, then selecting the Inventory box, which is the 
	second from the left. From the Inventory screen, you can press the right or left bumpers (R1 and L1) to navigate between different
	categories of items. These categories include:
</p>	
	<ul>
		<li>Tools</li>
		<li>Materials</li>
		<li>Key Items</li>
		<li>Spells</li>
		<li>Melee Weapons</li>
		<li>Ranged Weapons</li>
		<li>Catalysts</li>
		<li>Shields</li>
		<li>Head</li>
		<li>Chest</li>
		<li>Hands</li>
		<li>Legs</li>
		<li>Arrows/Bolts</li>
		<li>Rings</li>
		<li>Covenants</li>
		
	</ul>


<h3>Tools</h3>
<p>
	Tools are your basic consumable items. Most tools can be used at any time to cause a certain effect to happen. For example:
	if you use the Firebomb tool, you will throw a Firebomb and the total number of Firebombs in your inventory will decrease by one.
	
	
</p>

<h4 class="multitool">Multiplayer Tools</h4>
<p class="multip">Some tools are used specifically for connecting with other players, these are called Multiplayer Tools.</p>

<h4 class="multitool">White Sign Soapstone</h4>
<p class="multip">
	Buy this item from the Shrine Handmaiden for 500 souls. Use the White Sign Soapstone to leave a Summon Sign on the ground. Players in other games
	can activate your Summon Sign to summon you as a phantom in their world to help them progress through their game. If you find a Summon Sign in your own game,
	you can activate it to summon another player to help you progress through your own game.
</p>

<h4 class="multitool">Black Separation Crystal</h4>
<p class="multip">
	Use the Black Separation Crystal to make friendly phantoms leave your world. Some paths are blocked if you have friendly phantoms in your world,
	so you may have to use this to progress. Cannot banish invading phantoms.
</p>

<img class="multip" src="../media/images/black_separation_crystal.png" alt="Black Separation Crystal" title="Activate the Black Separation Crystal to banish friendly phantoms from your world." />

<h4 class="multitool">Embers</h4>
<p class="multip">
	Whenever you use an Ember (or whenever you kill a boss), your character will go into the Embered state until they die. While Embered, your character will have increased HP,
	added particle effects on their clothing, and the ability to summon other players who have left their Summon Sign down. Beware though,
	Embering and summoning phantoms to help will increase the chance of an invading player to enter your world and try to kill you. 
</p>

<h4 class="multitool">Cracked Red Eye Orbs/Red Eye Orb</h4>
<p class="multip">
	When used, Red Eye Orbs will cause you to invade another player's world in an attempt to kill them. Cracked Red Eye Orbs can only be used
	once, but once you get a full Red Eye Orb you can invade an unlimited number of times.
</p>
