<h2>Equipment</h2>

<div id="leftside">
<h3>Equipment Overview</h3>
<p>
	Equipment refers to any item that can be equipped onto your character such as weapons, shields, armor, rings, etc. You can view your currently
	equipped items in the Equipment Screen.
</p>

<h3>Accessing the Equipment Screen</h3>
<p>
	To access the equipent menu, press the Start button and select the left-most box.
	Here the screen is divided into three divisions: Loadout, Item Info, and Player Status.
</p>

<p>
	When a player presses any button on the D-Pad in the Equipment Menu, they will navigate around the Loadout division and hover over different item slots. The piece of equipment
	being hovered over (if there is any in the slot) will be displayed in the Item Info division. This will tell:
	
	<ul>
		<li>The name of the item.</li>
		<li>What type of item it is.</li>
		<li>The item's weight.</li>
		<li>The item's weapon art if it's a weapon.</li>
		<li>What type of damage it deals if it's a weapon.</li>
		<li>The item's durability.</li>
		<li>Its Focus Point cost to perform a weapon art.</li>
		<li>Its defenses against certain elements.</li>
		<li>How much bleed, poison or frost status it can inflict on enemies.</li>
		<li>How well it scales with certain stats. Weapons have scaling ratings of E, D, C, B, A, and S, the lowest scale rating being E.
			(Attributes from left to right: Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence and Faith.)
		</li>
		<li>
			The stat requirements of the equipment. You must have at least the minimum number of stat points in the required stats to wield that equipment effectively.
			Otherwise, you will swing slower than usual and will deal significantly less damage.
			
			(Attributes from left to right: Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence and Faith.)
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>	

<p>
	If you press X on an occupied slot, the item will become unequipped.
	
	If you press A while hovering over an empty slot, you will be given a menu of all the items you have that could potentially fill that slot.
	
	If you press X on this screen, you will be able to see a more detailed description of the item. This will tell you the lore behind the item, and 
	can also explain any special effects or Weapons Arts the item might have.
	
	Press A over the item you want to equip to equip it.
</p>

<h3>The Quick Item Slots</h3>
<p>
	The bottom 10 slots in the Loadout division are your Quick Item Slots. Here you can equip consumable items such as your Estus Flasks, Embers, Firebombs, etc. to
	use at a moment's notice. While in game, you can scroll through the Quick Item slot by pressing down on the D-Pad. If you hold down on the 
	D-Pad, you will automatically scroll back to the first item in the Quick Item list.
	Press X to use whichever item you have selected. 
</p>

<h3>Player Status Division</h3>
<p>
	The Player Status division displays specific information about your character, such as its:
	
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Level</strong> - How many total stats you have.</li>
		<li><strong>Stat Distribution</strong> - How many points you have distributed into your main stats.</li>
		<li><strong>HP (Health Points)</strong> - How much damage you can take before you die. You can increase your HP by leveling up the Vigor stat.</li>
		<li><strong>FP (Focus Points</strong>) - Resource consumed when casting spells or performing Weapon Arts (similar to Mana in other games). You can increase the number of Attunement Slots by leveling up the Attunement stat.</li>
		<li><strong>Stamina</strong> - Determines how many actions you can make in combat before needing to back off. You can increase your max Stamina by leveling up the Endurance stat.</li>
		<li><strong>Equip Load</strong> - Shows the total weight of everything you are wearing over / your max Equip Load. At the top of the screen you can see your Weight Ratio. 
			Always keep your Weight Ratio below 70%. You can increase your maximum Equip Load by leveling up the Vitality stat.</li>
		<li><strong>Poise</strong> - Supposed to determine how much you can resist staggering when hit by enemies, however this stat seems to actually do nothing in <cite>Dark Sousl 3</cite>
			You can increase your Poise by wearing heavy armor.</li>
		<li><strong>Item Discovery</strong> - Determines the chance of rare items to drop from enemies. You can increase your Item Discovery by leveling up the Luck stat.</li>
		<li><strong>Attunement Slots</strong> - Determines how many spells you can have equipped at a time. You can increase the number of Attunement Slots by leveling up the Attunement stat.</li>
	
	</ul>
</p>

<p>	
	If you press Y on this page, the stats shown above will be replaced by:
	
	<ul>
		<li>The Attack Power of the different attacks of your weapon - How much damage you'll do with your attacks.</li>
		<li>Your Defense and Absorption of different kinds of Physical and Elemental damage - The defense stats can be increased by wearing different armor.</li>
		<li>Your resistances to the Bleed, Poison, Frost and Curse Status Effects</li>
	</ul>
