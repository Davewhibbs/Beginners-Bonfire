	<h3>Role-Playing Overview</h3>
	<p>
		At its core, <cite>Dark Souls 3</cite> is a role-playing game, which means that you, the player, assume the role of the playable character. 
		The real fun in this game emerges when you get creative about who your character is, and <cite>Dark souls 3</cite> does a great job of giving players 
		creative freedom when it comes to character customization. You can name them whatever you like, change their appearance to your satisfaction, and 
		have a huge variety of weapons, armor, and spells at your disposal. Because the actual story
		in the game is fairly vague, it encourages the player to project their own story onto it.
 
		
	</p>
	
	<h3>Statistics</h3>
	<p>
		The most important thing to keep in mind to succeed in <cite>Dark Souls 3</cite> are your character's stats. Basically, the stats are a numerical representation of how powerful your character is in
		certain fields. Here is a list to explain each stat and whether or not you should level it during your playthrough:
	</p>
	
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Vigor</strong> - Determines your Max Health Points. Level this to make your character more beefy so they can absorb more hits.</li>
			<li><strong>Attunement</strong> - Determines your Max Focus Points (like Mana in other games) and your number of Attunement Slots which you can equip spells to. Level this if you plan on making a character that uses magic.</li>
			<li><strong>Endurance</strong> - Determines your Max Stamina. Stamina is really important because almost every action has a stamina cost. Level this on every character so they can swing their weapon more, dodge more, run further, and cast more spells without waiting for stamina to recharge.</li>
			<li><strong>Vitality</strong> - Determines your Max Equip Load. Basically, this is stat to level if you want to wear heavy armor. Leveling Vitality will allow you to wear heavy gear and still be able to dodge roll properly.</li>
			<li><strong>Strength</strong> - Determines weapon damage for Strength Scaling weapons. The damage of some weapons scales with your Strength Stat. Usually these weapons are big and slow, but pack quite a punch.</li>
			<li><strong>Dexterity</strong> - Determines weapon damage for Dexterity Scaling weapons. Like Strength, the damage of some weapons scale with Dexterity. These weapons are usually smaller and have faster swing animations, but tend to do less damage per swing than Strength weapons. (Note: Many
											weapons scale with both Strength and Dexterity to some degree.)</li>
			<li><strong>Faith</strong> - Determines the effectiveness of Miracles. Miracles are like light magic, so increase your Faith if you want to make a cleric or paladin-like character that utilizes lightning and healing.</li>
			<li><strong>Intelligence</strong> - Determines the effectiveness of Sorceries and Pyromancies. Sorceries are another type of magic that is more arcane, and Pyromancies are the third and final form of magic which is all based on fire. 
				If you like shooting magic missles or throwing fireballs, level up Intelligence.</li>
			<li><strong>Luck</strong> - Determines Item Discovery Chance and effectiveness of Bleed or Poison weapons. I don't recommend putting any points into Luck as a beginner, because it is not helpful in combat unless you're making
				a bleed or poison build. In that case, level up Luck to increase the speed of bleed or poison build up, but it won't increase the damage done.</li>
		
		
		</ul>
		
	<p>
		It is important to plan out what you want your character to be before you start the game. This will allow you to most efficiently allocate your stats so that you don't waste any levels on stats you won't be utilizing.
		For example: I want to make a character that is like a barbarian of sorts and only uses heavy weapons to deal damage. I would never put any points into any of the magic stats (Faith, Intelligence, Attunement), because I won't be using magic at all. Instead, I'll focus more
		of my points into Strength, so that I can wield heavier weapons and deal more damage with them. Efficiently allocating stats will allow me to make the character I want stronger in his specific specialty faster than if I just threw levels into
		random stats. When you plan your stats out like this, it is called a build. A Strength build is one that focuses on leveling Strength. Likewise a Magic build might focus more on leveling Intelligence. There are endless possibilities for builds,
		so be creative when you plan it out!
	</p>
	
	<h3>Starting Classes</h3>
		
	<p>
		When creating a new character, a player is given the choice between 10 starting classes. It's important to keep in mind that <cite>Dark Souls 3</cite> is not a 
		class based game, and the only impact this starter class will have is what gear and starting stats your character will have. For example, you could choose to start as a Theif, which only has a small dagger and a shortbow, but you could still
		mold that Theif into a character that uses gigantic weapons to smash his opponents with. Your starting class doesn't matter. That being said, not all starting classes are made equal. They each start with
		different weapons, armor, and stats, so certain starter classes are better for certain builds. Below are detailed descriptions of each Starting Class and which builds they are most efficient for:
	</p>
	
	<h4>Knight</h4>
	<p>
		A heavily armored knight with a solid shield and a longsword. Starts with the best starting stats for most builds. Best starting option for an absolute beginner.
	</p>

		if you want to throw some spells in too.
	</p>

	<h4>Warrior</h4>
	<p>

		Only choose if you don't want to use any spells. Starts with a battle-axe and a wooden shield.

	<h4>Herald</h4>
	<p>
		A herald with moderate armor, a solid shield, a spear, a talisman (item used to cast miracles), and a weak healing miracle. The herald's stats aren't spectacularly optimized for most builds,
		but the spear and the shield are great starting gear for beginners and veterans alike.

	<h4>Thief</h4>
	<p>
		A thief with light armor, a knife meant for backstabbing, a small shield and a shortbow. Has the highest Luck stat of every class, meaning it has the highest Item Discovery chance and is good
		for Bleed/Poison builds. It's also the only class that starts with a bow if you want to make an archer character.

	<h4>Assassin</h4>
	<p>
		A light-armored assassin who uses sorceries as well as weapons to quickly dispose of enemies. Starts with a small shield for parrying, a thrusting sword, a staff for casting Sorceries, and a sorcery that negates
		fall damage and reduces the noise your footsteps make. Good for pure Dexterity builds, and Intelligence/Dexterity builds like a spellsword character.
	</p>

	</table>
	
	<h4>Sorcerer</h4>
	<p>
		A light-armored mage with high Intelligence and Attunement. Starts with a staff, a light damaging projectile sorcery and a heavier damaging projectile sorcery, a small shield for parrying, a weak dagger, and
		a ring that increases magic damage. This class requires more patience to play because of its almost total reliance on sorceries. It can be very difficult in the beginning of the game, but as 
		you level up and find better sorceries, you can become an incredibly strong magic force.
		Good for full Intelligence builds that utilize a lot of sorceries.

	<h4>Pyromancer</h4>
	<p>
		A light-armored pyromancer who wields a hand-axe, a wooden shield, a Pyromancy Flame (for casting Pyromancies), a ring which boosts Pyromancy damage, and the Fireball Pyromancy. Starts with high 
		Intelligence and Faith, meaning it's a great class if you want to use all forms of magic. A fantastic class for beginners because of its ranged fireballs as well as the close-quarters hand-axe.
		A good jack-of-all-trades class.

	<h4>Cleric</h4>
	<p>
		A light-armored cleric who starts with a mace, a wooden shield, a chime for casting miracles, and the miracles Heal and Force. Has the highest starting Faith of all the classes as well as
		fairly good Strength, making it ideal for a Strength/Faith or pure Faith builds. The Heal miracle is good to have for it you run out of Estus (healing potions).

	<h4>Deprived</h4>
	<p>
		An unclothed enigma. Starts with nothing but a loincloth, a plank shield, and a wooden club. This class is a wild card - all of its stats start at 10 so you can build anything out of it.
		It is a balanced class for trying new builds, but is rarely optimal for min/maxing on your stats. Because of the terrible starting equipment, and the fact that other classes with more focused stat distribution will
		often times lead to better stat optimization for builds, I do not recommend choosing the Deprived if you are a beginner.
